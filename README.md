# Google Stock Price Prediction

Stock price analysis has been a critical area of research and is one of the top applications of machine learning. In this project we perform stock price prediction using machine learning and deep learning techniques. We use an LSTM network to train our model with Google stocks data.

This project is part of my solution for the Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks course.
